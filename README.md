# CollectionSynthesis
This repository contains my third-year research and paper at SPBU (Department of Software Engineering). The subject of the research is data structure (or *collection*) synthesis, special case of program synthesis.

A future tool would automatically create data structure implementations from formal specifications written in declarative DSL.
